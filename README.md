For positive samples, 480 experimental verified RGENs were collected from literature.
And by CD-HIT (setting 70% threshold), finally 389 RGENs samples were filtered.        
For negative samples, samples were collected based on the following criteria:
>* Must not be known or putative Class II effector proteins.
>* Must be isolated from phage or bacterial MGEs (known or putative MGEs).
>* must have < 40% sequence similarity to each other and the positive samples.

The composition of positive samples and negative samples are listed below.

* Positive samples 

`389 RNA guided endonuclease, RGENs (Cas9/Cas12/IscB/TnpB/Cas13)` 

* Negative samples

`719 Class II CRISPR-Cas accessory proteins / Class I CRIPSR-Case `

Test data

>* BEST (18)  
>* Proteins to be validated (7)  
>* TnpB (59)  
>* Fanzor (11)  
>* Cas12n (7)  

Totally,330 negative samples were collected and the composition of positive samples are listed below.
